# get_next_line
get_next_line
Overview

The get_next_line function is designed to read a line from a file descriptor (fd). It processes the input file or stream incrementally, returning one line at a time until the end of the file (EOF) is reached or an error occurs.
Function Prototype

```char *get_next_line(int fd);```

Files Included

    get_next_line.c: Contains the main implementation of the get_next_line function.
    get_next_line_utils.c: Contains helper functions used by get_next_line.
    get_next_line.h: The header file containing the necessary function prototypes and includes.

Function Parameters

    fd: The file descriptor from which to read.

Return Value

    char *: A pointer to the string containing the next line from the file descriptor.
    NULL: Indicates one of the following:
        End of file is reached.
        An error occurred during reading.
        Memory allocation failed.

External Functions Used

    read: Reads from the file descriptor.
    malloc: Allocates memory dynamically.
    free: Frees allocated memory.

Description

The get_next_line function reads from the specified file descriptor and returns a single line, including the newline character (\n) if present. The function ensures correct behavior for multiple consecutive calls, allowing you to read a file line by line.
Key Features:

    Handles multiple file descriptors simultaneously (if implemented with static variables).
    Optimized to handle incomplete lines or lines longer than a typical buffer size.
    Manages memory carefully to avoid leaks or undefined behavior.

How It Works

    Buffer Management: The function uses a buffer to read chunks of data from the file descriptor. The size of this buffer is typically defined as BUFFER_SIZE in the header file.
    Line Construction: Data from the buffer is processed to extract a line. If the line is incomplete, the function continues reading until a newline character or EOF is encountered.
    Dynamic Allocation: Lines are constructed using dynamic memory allocation to ensure compatibility with lines of arbitrary length.
    Static Variables: A static variable stores any leftover data from the buffer to ensure continuity between calls.

Compilation

Ensure all necessary files are included during compilation. Example using gcc:

gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=32 get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c -o get_next_line

Notes on BUFFER_SIZE:

    BUFFER_SIZE is a critical parameter that determines how much data is read in a single call to read(). It must be defined during compilation or within the header file.

Usage Example

#include "get_next_line.h"
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int fd = open("example.txt", O_RDONLY);
    if (fd < 0)
        return (1);

    char *line;
    while ((line = get_next_line(fd)) != NULL)
    {
        printf("%s", line);
        free(line);
    }
    close(fd);
    return (0);
}

Error Handling

    Invalid fd: The function will return NULL if the file descriptor is invalid.
    Memory Allocation Failure: If malloc fails, the function will return NULL and clean up any allocated memory.
    EOF or Read Error: Returns NULL if the end of the file is reached or a read error occurs.

Requirements and Recommendations

    Ensure proper management of memory by freeing lines returned by the function.
    Test with different file descriptors and BUFFER_SIZE values to verify functionality.
    Use tools like valgrind to check for memory leaks and undefined behavior.

Limitations

    Behavior with BUFFER_SIZE <= 0 is undefined unless explicitly handled in the implementation.
    May not handle binary files correctly, as it assumes text input.

Notes

This implementation adheres to the requirements and constraints outlined in the project description. The functionality of get_next_line makes it suitable for reading text files, configuration files, or even standard input.
